    "# # Building Insulation Simulation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## The Objective\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This project simulates the thermal performance of a single-room building in two different climates: a temperate climate (like Berlin) and a tropical climate (like Kuala Lumpur). The goal is to visually demonstrate the value of good insulation by comparing a \"poorly insulated\" vs. a \"well-insulated\" building.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## The Physics\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The core of this simulation is the heat transfer equation for conduction, which is used to calculate the rate of heat loss or gain through the building's walls and roof.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The overall heat transfer coefficient, or U-value, is the inverse of the total thermal resistance (R-value). A lower U-value means better insulation.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$U = \\frac{1}{\\sum R} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{d_1}{k_1} + \\frac{d_2}{k_2} + \\dots}$$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The rate of heat transfer, $Q$, is calculated as:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$Q = U \\cdot A \\cdot (T_{indoor} - T_{outdoor})$$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where:\n",
    "# * $U$: Overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K)\n",
    "# * $A$: Total surface area of the building envelope (m²)\n",
    "# * $T_{indoor}$: Desired indoor temperature (K or °C)\n",
    "# * $T_{outdoor}$: Outdoor temperature (K or °C)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# A positive $Q$ value indicates heat gain (cooling needed), and a negative $Q$ value indicates heat loss (heating needed). The total energy required for heating or cooling is the absolute sum of these values over time."
